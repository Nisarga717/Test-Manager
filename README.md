## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-manager.git
   cd test-manager

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Set up the Mock API:**

  Make sure you have json-server installed globally (or install it locally):
   ```bash
  npm install -g json-server
  ```
4. **Then, in the project root, run:**

  ```bash
  json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
  ```
## Usage

After installing dependencies and setting up the mock API, follow these steps to use the application:

1. **Start the Mock API:**
   - Open a terminal in the project root and run:
     ```bash
     json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
     ```
   - This will start the mock API at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   - In another terminal, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The app will launch in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Navigating the Application:**
   - **Test Cases Page:**
     - View the list of test cases with details like title, description, execution status, priority, associated test suite, and assigned user.
     - Use the search bar to filter test cases by keywords.
     - Utilize filters and sorting options (if enabled) for better organization.
     - Click the **"New Test Case"** button to open a pop-up dialog for adding a new test case.
     - Edit or delete existing test cases using the corresponding action buttons. Notifications will confirm these actions.
   - **Test Suites Page:**
     - Manage test suites with similar functionality: view, search, add, edit, and delete test suites.
   - **User Assignment:**
     - In the Test Case form, assign a test case to a user using the provided dropdown.
   - **Dark Mode:**
     - Toggle between light and dark themes using the dark mode toggle button in the navigation bar.

4. **Notifications:**
   - Pop-up notifications (Snackbars) will appear to inform you of successful add, update, or delete actions, or to alert you when errors occur.

## After Installation

Once you have the project up and running, here are some next steps and additional considerations:

- **Customization:**
  - **Theme Customization:** Modify the `theme.js` file (located in the `styles` folder) to change colors, fonts, and other design elements.
  - **API Integration:** Update the API endpoints in the Redux actions if you decide to connect to a real backend service.
  - **Feature Enhancements:** Consider adding additional features like detailed reporting, user roles, or integration with CI/CD pipelines.

- **Deployment:**
  - You can deploy the application on hosting platforms such as **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **Heroku** for public access.
  - Make sure to update the API endpoints if needed when deploying.

- **Contributing:**
  - Contributions are welcome! Please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines on how to get started.

- **Screenshots:**
  - Update the screenshots in the repository (under a `screenshots` folder) and the README to reflect the current UI and features.
